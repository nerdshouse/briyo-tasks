### Tech Debt / Known Issues

- `npm audit` reports moderate (esbuild/vite dev server) and high (undici, transitive via Firebase) vulnerabilities; fixing fully would require a major Vite upgrade.
- Large bundle warning: consider code-splitting or manual chunks for the main JS bundle.
- Daily WhatsApp reminder (daily tasks) is not implemented; only task-assignment WhatsApp is wired.
